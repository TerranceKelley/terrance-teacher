# Terrance Teacher

Terrance Teacher is an **agentic AI-powered personal teacher** designed to train experienced DevOps and platform engineers in **LLM engineering, agentic AI systems, and AI infrastructure**.

Unlike traditional tutorials or chatbots, this system:
- Assesses existing knowledge
- Teaches concepts incrementally
- Assigns hands-on tasks
- Grades responses and code
- Tracks weaknesses over time
- Adapts the curriculum automatically

This project is both a **learning engine** and a **demonstration of real-world agentic AI architecture**.

## Why This Exists

Most AI learning resources are:
- Passive (videos, blogs)
- Beginner-focused
- Not system-oriented
- Not verifiable

Terrance Teacher is built to:
- Teach **how AI systems actually fail**
- Emphasize production tradeoffs
- Require validation before advancing
- Mirror how senior engineers learn on the job
